# NLP Supervised Classification 

**ITS NOT OPTIMZED.**

This project tackles the problem of sorting text into categories like spam, sexist content, and hate speech. To do this, we test different classification models, including Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Trees, LinearSVC, and Lbl2Vec. We also experiment with text vectorization methods like TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer, Hashing Vectorizer, and Doc2Vec. These tools are especially important when dealing with datasets where some categories have fewer examples than others. We explore data augmentation techniques to help balance these datasets.
